# Online Coding
All the files of the main branch can be cloned into a folder.
After that the files of branch 'ide' to be downloaded/cloned seperately and must be put inside a folder named 'ide'
as the path of these files have been used inside the code.

Code will run on localhost/FolderName/index.html and the localhost should be run by wamp server as the backend part is done in php
and the code gets pushed to the backend only if we will run it via wamp local server.

This is how the code should be cloned.
Hackathon folder has all the code that is present in 'main' branch and ide has the code that is in 'ide' branch.
